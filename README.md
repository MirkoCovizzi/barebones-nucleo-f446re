# barebones-nucleo-f446re

Barebones project template for the **STM32F446RE** using **CMake**. It doesn't contain any HAL dependency. Useful for who likes to write
their own HAL from scratch using the microcontroller documentation. It is fully compatible with **CLion**.

* `/documentation` contains the datasheet and the reference

* `/examples/led_button.c` is a simple example that uses low level abstraction for button and LED interaction
